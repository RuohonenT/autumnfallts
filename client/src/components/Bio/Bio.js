                <p>Known as the guitarist and songwriter of the deceased group Fall of the Leafe, Jussi Hänninen finally returns with his new band called Autumnfall.
                One could say Autumnfall is unofficially the official continuation to Fall of the Leafe's first two albums "Evanescent, Everfading" (1998) and "August Wernicke" (1999).
                The band's name is derived from F.O.T.L's demo "Storm of the Autumnfall" (1996).<br />
                    <br />
                So how did we get here?<br />
                It was during the summer of 2019 when Jussi wrote "The Gatherer" and soon realised he had something in his hand that truly had potential.
                In need of a vocalist he recruited Tero Ruohonen on vocals and soon after Olli Pirkkanen (Scapes, Mind Abduction) joined as the drummer.
                During 2019 and 2020 the band recorded album worhts of material and thus "Ghosts of Light" was birthed. Mixed and mastered by Eero Seppälä in Blacksmith Audio
                the album is now ready and will be released in xxx.<br />
                    <br />
                The fire was always there...<br />
