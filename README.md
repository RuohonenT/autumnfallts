A React App to be used as a simple band website. Still in progress!

Backend created using PostgresSQL, TypeOrm, Node.js and TypeScript.
Frontend created using JavaScript, CSS... and lots of Google.
In addition Heroku and Firebase are being used to store data.

Better readme file coming up when project is otherwise finished.
